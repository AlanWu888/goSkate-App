            <p>Don’t know what tricks to use in a game of SKATE? Or do you want to test your flat
                ground skating abilities? The S.K.A.T.E dice in the goSkate app can be used to solve
                these problems! The S.K.A.T.E dice allows you to randomly roll tricks from your own
                list
                or from a pre-set list of tricks with different levels of difficulty built into
                them.</p>
            <p>To get started with the S.K.A.T.E dice, choose to play with your own list of tricks
                or from a pre-set list.</p>

            <br>
            <h2 class="center-text">Playing with a pre-set list</h2>
            <p>If you have chosen to play with a pre-set list, simply pick from one of the options
                listed to you. This will then take you to the SKATE screen.</p>

            <br>
            <h2 class="center-text">Playing with a custom list</h2>
            <p>If you have chosen to make your own custom list of tricks, you will be taken to a
                screen which allows you to add tricks to a list. To get started with this, simply
                press the input box at the bottom of the screen to bring up your keyboard, type in a
                trick and press the “add trick” button. Once you have entered at least 5 tricks, you
                will be able to start playing your custom game of S.K.A.T.E using the “play” button
                located at the top of the screen.</p>

            <br>
            <h2 class="center-text">Playing S.K.A.T.E</h2>
            <p>To start your game of S.K.A.T.E, press the “Start” button to roll the first trick of
                the game. Once this is pressed, a trick will be displayed to you to attempt in the
                top half of the screen; give the trick an attempt. If you land the trick with the
                first attempt, press the green tick button; otherwise press the red cross button.
                Pressing either of these buttons will advance the game by rolling the next trick for
                you to try, however pressing the red cross will give you a letter. </p>
            <p>The game ends when you collect 5 letters (S, K, A, T, E) or if you successfully
                complete all the tricks in the list! Remember though that before getting your last
                letter (E), you have two tries of the final trick. </p>
