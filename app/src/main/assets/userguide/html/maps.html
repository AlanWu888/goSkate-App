            <h2 class="center-text">Using the Maps</h2>
            <p>The “Map” tab on the goSkate app allows you to view all skate locations on our
                databases on a map. Different location types are represented using different
                coloured map markers.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Skate shops are represented by Red markers</li>
                <li>Skate spots are represented by Blue markers</li>
                <li>Skate parks are represented by Yellow markers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Pressing on a marker will display a card with the name of the location, and a short
                description of the location itself. Additionally, two small buttons will appear on
                the screen in the bottom right-hand side of the screen, of which open the location
                in google maps, allowing you to view the location’s address or navigate to it.</p>
            <br>
            <h2 class="center-text">Adding a location to the map</h2>
            <p>Can’t find your local skatepark? You can always request for it to be added by using
                the location adding feature on goSkate. This can be accessed through the “plus”
                button in the bottom right-hand side of the Map tab. Pressing on this will bring up
                a new screen which asks you which type of location you would like to add, after
                selecting one of the options, the next screen will prompt you to fill in some
                details about the location. Once all fields are filled, you will be able to submit
                your location for approval by an admin user, of which if suitable, your location
                will be added to the Maps tab within 24 hours. </p>
            <b>To use this feature, you must be signed in.</b>
